# HTML_Doodles
This is a repo to practice various input scenarios with HTML as part of the learning process.
I will add to this as time goes on and my HTML files become more advanced and I will put these more advanced files within their own folder set,
but within this folder/repo/Directory/repository HTML_Doodles.
